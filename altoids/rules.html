<h4 id="draw-lots-cut-for-high-card">Draw Lots (Cut for High Card)</h4>
<p>Often used to determine dealer, teams or first player. Each player
reveals a random card from the deck. High card wins. Aces are high. For
teams, the top 2 are a team, then the next 2 are a team, etc.</p>
<h4 id="blackjack-or-21">Blackjack or 21</h4>
<p><em>Classic casino game to get 21 without going over for 1+
Players</em></p>
<p>Numerical cards are at face values, face cards at 10, and aces are
valued at 1 or 11. Deal 2 cards first-one revealed to players. On your
turn, if you have less than 21 points revealed you may "hit" being given
another face up card or "stand" keeping you hand total. Once all players
have chosen to "stand", fold or busted (going over 21) all cards are
revealed. Hand total closer to 21 without busting wins. In casino
variants, all players play with revealed cards against the house hand,
which wins ties, is forced to hit on 16 or less, and stay on 17 or more.
After all players turns, the house hand is fully revealed before it
"plays".</p>

"bluff" before the next player plays cards, those cards are revealed. If
