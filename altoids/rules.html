<h4 id="draw-lots-cut-for-high-card">Draw Lots (Cut for High Card)</h4>
<p>Often used to determine dealer, teams or first player. Each player
reveals a random card from the deck. High card wins. Aces are high. For
teams, the top 2 are a team, then the next 2 are a team, etc.</p>
<h4 id="blackjack-or-21">Blackjack or 21</h4>
<p><em>Players 1+</em> Numerical cards are at face values, face cards at
10, and aces are valued at 1 or 11. Deal 2 cards first-one revealed to
players. On your turn, if you have less than 21 points revealed you may
"hit" being given another face up card or "stand" keeping you hand
total. Once all players have chosen to "stand", fold or busted (going
over 21) all cards are revealed. Hand total closer to 21 without busting
wins. In casino variants, all players play with revealed cards against
the house hand, which wins ties, is forced to hit on 16 or less, and
stay on 17 or more. After all players turns, the house hand is fully
revealed before it "plays".</p>

face down. If a challenger calls your "bluff" before the next player
plays cards, those cards are revealed. If the revealed cards don't match
what was called you take the discard pile to your hand. If they do

cards.</p>

pool. If the card drawn is the card asked for reveal it and take another
turn. If at any time you have a quartet, and the cards must be placed
down face up. When all quartets have been completed, the player with the
most quartets wins.</p>

cards. Before play begins player may swap cards between their hand and
face up cards, but they may not even look at the face down cards. On you
turn, you must discard 1 or more cards, all of the same rank equal to or
higher rank than the last card discarded or you must take the entire
discard pile into your hand. Downcards are played site unseen and if the
card played is less than the last discard you take the entire discard
pile into your hand. The lowest rank card (a 1) may be played on any
card, and any card may follow it. 10s may be played on any card, and
then the discard is removed from the game. The same player then goes
again starting a new discard. If 4 cards of the same rank are on top of
the discard pile either all at once or across multiple turns, it is the
same as a 10. The last player to empty their hand, upcards and downcards
loses.</p>

left player, getting one from the right player. Once you have a quartet,
you may grab a spoon. After any player, grabs a spoon all player may
grab a spoon. The last player without a spoon, loses the hand. If the
first player who touched a spoon did not have a quartet, they instead
lose the hand. When you lose the hand, you get one letter in
