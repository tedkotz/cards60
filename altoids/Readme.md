Mint Tin Playing Cards
======================
This is a custom set of print and play cards and instruction sheet sized such 
that if printed on standard US 8.5x11 paper that cards will fit in an 
Altoids<sup>:registered:</sup> tin for ease of transport.

These cards are the 60-card compatible deck of playing cards. 
The instruction sheet is a set of rules for common card games.


#### Notes

Instruction sheet should be accordion folded 3x5 to fit nicely in the tin.
This means it could be split in to 30 little pages to organize the games.

The target size of the playing cards themselves is 2x3.5 which means 12 could
be fit on an 8.5x11 piece of paper. Which would only require 5 sheet of paper
for all 60 card. if you wanted to monochrome print them in black and red, then
it would take 6.
