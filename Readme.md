Alternative deck design
=======================

Being a highly composite number a 60 card deck should allow for a greater variety of games than the standard 52-card deck.

For example, it can be evenly dealt between 2,3,4,5, or 6 players allowing for trick taking games with other than 4 players.

- 52 can be evenly dealt between 2,4,13,26
- 56 can be evenly dealt between 2,4,7,8,14,28
- 60 can be evenly dealt between 2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30
- 64 can be evenly dealt between 2,4,8,16,32
- 68 can be evenly dealt between 2,4,17,34
- 48 can be evenly dealt between 2,3,4,6,8,12,16,24

60 Compatible
-------------
Every card from the standard 52-card deck has an equivalent so you can easily filter
down to a 52-card deck is needed. 2 more ranks are added to get to 60 cards 1s and Maids.
The ten can also be abbreviated as the 0 in the corner, but with 10 icons.

60 Compromise
-------------
This is a split that highlights making the cards as divisible as possible.
There are only 12 Ranks, so we merge the Jack and 10.
The 5 suits are not divisible so the suits don't directly follow the colors.

60 Decimalized
--------------
The ranks of the cards could be reduced down to just the 10 digits.
This then allows for there to be 6 suits, which is also a highly composite number
So it can be split into 2 different sub-groupings (of 2 or 3) maybe by color and
general shape?

#### Draw Lots (Cut for High Card)
Often used to determine
dealer, teams or first
player. Each player
reveals a random card
from the deck. High card
wins. Aces are high.
For teams, the top 2 are
a team, then the next 2
are a team, etc.

#### Blackjack or 21
*Players 1+*
Numerical cards are at
face values, face cards
at 10, and aces are
valued at 1 or 11. Deal 2
cards first-one revealed
to players. On your turn,
if you have less than 21
points revealed you may
"hit" being given another
face up card or "stand"
keeping you hand total.
Once all players have
chosen to "stand", fold
or busted (going over 21)
all cards are revealed.
Hand total closer to 21
without busting wins.
In casino variants, all
players play with revealed
cards against the house
hand, which wins ties, is
forced to hit on 16 or
less, and stay on 17 or
more. After all players
turns, the house hand is
fully revealed before it
"plays".

number of 1 or more cards
and rank up or down 1
from the rank called by
the last player and
discard that many cards
face down. If a
challenger calls your
"bluff" before the next
player plays cards, those
cards are revealed. If
the revealed cards don't
match what was called you
take the discard pile to
your hand. If they do
match, the challenger
takes them instead. You
win when you run out of
cards.

#### Crazy Eights
*Players 2-8*
Each player gets 5 cards.
Discard top card of deck.
On each turn, You must
draw cards until you can
play a card that matches
the suit or rank of the
last  discard, or a
Crazy 8 (declaring a new
suit to match). Playing a
2 the next player must
draw 2 cards, unless they
play a 2 instead the
player after them must
draw 4 etc. Playing a
Queen skips the next
player. Playing an Ace
reverses the direction of
play. First to shed their
hand scores cards in all
opponent's hands
50 for 8s, rank for
numbers and 10 for others.

#### Go Fish

Deal players 5 cards.
Remaining cards are the
pool. On each turn you
ask any another player
for their cards of a
particular rank. They
must hand over all cards
of that rank if possible.
If they have none, then
you must "go fish" and
draw a card from the
pool. If the card drawn
is the card asked for

another turn. If at any
time you have a quartet,
and the cards must be
placed down face up. When
all quartets have been
completed, the player
with the most quartets wins.

Deal each player 9 cards,
3 downcards in a row,
3 upcards face up on the
downcards, and 3 hand
cards. The hand cards
must all be played before
upcards which must be
played before down cards.
Before play begins player
may swap cards between
their hand and face up
cards, but they may not
even look at the face
down cards. On you turn,
you must discard 1 or
more cards, all of the
same rank equal to or
higher rank than the last
card discarded or you
must take the entire
discard pile into your
hand. Downcards are
played site unseen and if
the card played is less
than the last discard you
take the entire discard
pile into your hand. The
lowest rank card (a 1)
may be played on any
card, and any card may
follow it. 10s may be
played on any card, and
then the discard is
removed from the game.
The same player then goes
again starting a new
discard. If 4 cards of
the same rank are on top
of the discard pile
either all at once or
across multiple turns, it
is the same as a 10. The
last player to empty
their hand, upcards and
downcards loses.

#### Spoons
*Players 3-15*
N players need N quartet of
cards and N-1 spoons or
similar safe hand held
objects. Place the spoons
in the middle of all the
players. Shuffle and deal
out the cards, 4 each.

after dealing is done.
Each player discarding a
card to the left player,
getting one from the
right player. Once you
have a quartet, you may grab
a spoon. After any player,
grabs a spoon all player
may grab a spoon. The last
player without a spoon,
loses the hand. If the
first player who touched
a spoon did not have a
quartet, they instead lose
the hand. When you lose
the hand, you get one
letter in "S-P-O-O-N-S".
The first player to get
all 6 letters loses the
game.

#### War

between all players,
discarding extras. For
each Battle, all players
reveal the top card of
their deck. The player
with the highest card
captures all other cards
putting them on the
bottom of their deck.
Ties result in a War
between tied players.
Each player in the war
plays an extra card face
down and then reveals a
card face up as in the

out of cards they lose
and are eliminated.
