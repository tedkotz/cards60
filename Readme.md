Alternative deck design
=======================

Being a highly composite number a 60 card deck should allow for a greater variety of games than the standard 52-card deck.

For example, it can be evenly dealt between 2,3,4,5, or 6 players allowing for trick taking games with other than 4 players.

- 52 can be evenly dealt between 2,4,13,26
- 56 can be evenly dealt between 2,4,7,8,14,28
- 60 can be evenly dealt between 2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30
- 64 can be evenly dealt between 2,4,8,16,32
- 68 can be evenly dealt between 2,4,17,34
- 48 can be evenly dealt between 2,3,4,6,8,12,16,24

60 Compromise
-------------
This is a split that highlights making the cards as divisible as possible.
There are only 12 Ranks, so we merge the Jack and 10.
The 5 suits are not divisible so the suits don't directly follow the colors.

60 Decimalized
--------------
The ranks of the cards could be reduced down to just the 10 digits.
This then allows for there to be 6 suits, which is also a highly composite number
So it can be split into 2 different sub-groupings (of 2 or 3) maybe by color and
general shape?

- Red
    - Diamonds
    - Hearts
    - Pentacles (or Stars)
- Black

- 0 (10)

#### Hearts
Trick taking game.
Lowest Clubs(1C) leads
first. Avoid capturing
hearts at 1 point a
piece or the queen of
spades, 13 points. No
leading a point card
until one is played.
Taking all the hearts
and the queen, gives
all points to each
opponent instead.
First to 500 loses.
